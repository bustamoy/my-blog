# Mark(Show)Down

Next came the task of selecting a Markdown editor.  I went through every editor mentioned in a few markdown editor lists.  I tried each one that met some or all of these criteria:

- Must be free
- Must be usable offline
- Provides a live preview on right side of screen that scrolls with the editor view
- Works directly with local files and does not need to store data in the cloud
- Supports vi-style controls.    

## Must be free

As the old saying goes, **"If it's free, it's for me"**  I don't see any reason (right now) to pay for a writing application when I can see from the lists that there is a multitude of free alternatives.  Some of these are open source so (theoretically) I can contribute changes that I'd like to see in to those products.

## No Cloud/Web Based Apps

A lot were cloud-based or web-based, so those were quickly removed.  A couple of them were more like a note taking app that supported Markdown and those were quickly skipped too.  There were many paid writing applications that looked interesting but of course they weren't free.

## Preview window

For a language that needs to be rendered, it is useful to see a preview of what the current content looks like.  It seems to me like a live preview showing the rendered output is the best way to give immediate feedback.  I am familiar with the code-build-test cycle and this is a similar process.

## Works directly with files

Some of the applications listed were note-taking apps similar to Evernote.  Being note-based, they used notebooks and synced with cloud providers like Box instead of using raw files and folders on the filesystem.  I need a more general markdown editor that is able to work with the Jekyll posts and other markdown files so I work with Github.

## Episode "VI": Return of the keybindings

I *could* use a mouse to control my editing experience, but **I really don't want to**.  I started using vi to edit files when started my first job in 2002.  I prefer vi controls but I am not a hard-liner on it.  This one is not a requirement per se, more like a strong desire.

## Attempt #1: VS Code

I started off with [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) because I was going to work on code for a project and why have two editors when just one will suffice?  It is also free!  I added in the [Markdown](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=yzhang.markdown-all-in-one), [linting](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint), [preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=shd101wyy.markdown-preview-enhanced), and [auto-preview](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=hnw.vscode-auto-open-markdown-preview) extensions that I found.  

Things worked fine if I was editing a single file, but when trying to open a second file to copy the frontmatter, the windows did not behave as expected.  Multiple preview tabs opened, editor tabs closed, and settings tab opened on whichever tab had focus.  I thought this was caused by the auto-preview extension so I disabled it.

Now when I open the preview window manually, it stays there and tracks the md files that I open in the lefthand tab(Group 1) as long as I don't give focus to the preview window(Group 2).  But once again, when I set focus on the preview tab and open a file for editing, that editor shows up in Group 2.  If I open the preview for the new editor, that creates a Group 3.  Also the Markdown Preview Enhanced creates another preview type and you can see how both are opened in Group 2.

On side note, the option "Toggle Preview Locking" does not prevent interaction or keep it as a static editor UI element.  It only serves to keep that  preview tab showing the same file's preview.    It is also only available on the built-in Preview type.

It turns out that the built-in Markdown support in VS Code does a decent job for the markdown that I write.  Preview(manual) and locking are good.  I think that the tab focus and extra preview tabs/groups is just how VS Code deals with tab groups and opening "to the side".

One positive is that the [vi extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vscodevim.vim) works well.

## Attempt #2: MacDown

All of the fighting I did with the VS Code extensions and preview tab hell caused me to want "just" a Markdown editor and nothing more.  I can use VS Code for all "coding", and [MacVim](https://macvim-dev.github.io/macvim/) for any non-Markdown text editing.

I like how fit-for-purpose [MacDown](https://macdown.uranusjr.com/) is.  I mean, take a look at that toolbar! It is also free and has all of the menu options one would expect for a Markdown editor, however it embeds images as base64 and does not have vi controls.  It does have [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) [frontmatter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/) parsing option that I enabled.

### Attempt #3: Haroopad

[Haroopad](http://pad.haroopress.com/) is a free, Markdown enabled editor with vi bindings which works directly with files and folders!  Hallelujah!  That being said, it is not compatible with github pages-based Jekyll, specifically in the image path specifications.  Haroopad also doesn't look like it is currently maintained, as evidenced by the last release [being in 2013](https://github.com/rhiokim/haroopad/releases).

### Attempt #4: VS Code (no extensions)

Another attempt at VS Code, starting with removing all extensions and purely using built-in features.  They even give a nice explanation  of [how to work with Markdown](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown).

Still had the same issue with editor tabs and active/focus and extra previews/tabs in group 3+.  There are some tab and editor management extensions, but I am not going to bother with those, and I don't see a way to use them to lock the "Preview" view into Group 2.

### Attempt #5: Typora

Last but not least, I tried out [Typora](https://typora.io/).  It definitely doesn't meet all of the [requirements](#markshowdown) but after reading [a post by Typora's creator](http://abnerlee.github.io/typora/2015/03/11/why-typora/), I understand the power of not having a separate preview window so I can focus on the content.  

It does handle images well, dragging them in from Finder will place them and it has a feature to copy those images to a configurable location based on some frontmatter configuration:

```yaml
typora-root-url: ../../
typora-copy-images-to: ../../images
```

![Typora image settings](/images/typora-settings-images.png)

That is how I came to use Typora for my Markdown writing.  I don't think it's the perfect editor, but it does serve its purpose well for me now.  I do see that it is "commercial" but free during beta and it only has a release about every three months, so I'll keep my eye on it.  I will probably switch to something else.
