# Working with archives

Many of the open source applications I tried came packaged as a zip from [GitHub](https://github.com/).  I checked my Applications folder and sure enough, I had [Keka](https://www.keka.io/en/), [The Unarchiver](https://theunarchiver.com/), and the Archive Utility that comes with macOS.  I removed The Unarchiver and followed [these instructions](https://github.com/aonez/Keka/wiki/Default-application#set-it-manually) to set Keka as the default extraction application for .zip files.

# Disk cleaning

While I was in the process of cleaning up the menubar, I thought I would also take a fresh look at my drive and clean out some ununsed applications and files.    There is just something troubling when the drive has less than 100GB free.  I used [DiskInventory X](http://www.derlien.com/) to see if there were any large, glaring items that I could get rid of easily.  The largest file was XCode.app at 16G.  I deleted a few apps and [AppCleaner](https://freemacsoft.net/appcleaner/) popped up to let me get rid of the extra configuration and other related folders.  I reviewed the hidden application folders in my home folder and cleaned out some of the items that I had uninstalled prior to using AppCleaner.

# Tunes

The last and final piece is getting my music/audio setup and ready to create a good working environment.  I have a few music types available to me:

* MP3s on my local hard drive
* Albums I purchased in my iTunes
* A lifetime Brain.fm subscription I picked up a few years ago
* Spotify Premium
* DI.fm Premium
* Amazon (Prime) Music

I decided to alternate between listening to [Brain.fm](https://www.brain.fm/) and [DI.fm](https://www.di.fm/).  I also installed the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/download/mac/) app for good measure.

## Brain.fm

Brain.fm uses a web player but I wanted a standalone application, preferably one with a menubar, since this would likely always be running/available.  I tried  [Fluid](https://fluidapp.com/) and it worked well but did not have a menubar option.  The next app I tried was [WebCatalog](https://webcatalogapp.com/) and it had both the ability to run an app with a menubar icon and an existing Brain.fm "package".

## DI.fm

DI.fm also utilizes a web player and for premium members it provides a streaming URLs with listening keys.  So, all that was left for me to do was find a menubar audio app that can play URLs.  The first app I tried was [foobar2000](https://www.foobar2000.org/mac), simply because I was already using it on my Windows machines.  It did not have a menubar option that I could find, so to the Trash it went.  Next, I looked through the audio-apps category on [macmenubar.com](https://macmenubar.com/audio-apps/) and opened background tabs for a few of them.

At this point I was falling asleep and thus concluded day 2.
