# Menubar

It was at this moment when I decided that my menubar contained too many unncessary icons.  A great tip I found online is that you can manage the menubar items can be reordered by holding the Command key and clicking/dragging the icon in the menubar to the desired position, or dragging the icon off the menubar altogether.  I then spent about an hour looking into Applescript or Automator applications for starting a time machine backup.  This would allow me to trigger a backup on demand and be able to remove the time machine menubar icon.  I followed a few examples that I found on the web but I could not get it to work, so it remains.


And thus concluded day 1, a very quick session.
