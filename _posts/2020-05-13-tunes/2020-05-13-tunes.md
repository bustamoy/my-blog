# Tunes

I tried [Vox](https://vox.rocks/) and it has everything I am looking for.  A nice menubar icon and ability to have either a single icon or icons for music controls.  The only nagging thing was Vox putting their "Cloud" icon in the menubar, but the suggestion in [this comment](https://vox.rocks/forum/t/loop-icon-in-taskbar-keeps-coming-back/4786/6) works great.  I downloaded a .PLS from DI.fm with all of my favorite channels and Vox imported them with no issues.  I also changed the hotkeys to use the Command-Option-Control with the F7/F8/F9 

# Organizing cloud storage

I have a few cloud storage accounts, as I'm sure most people with internet access do.  I use [odrive](https://odrive.com/) to synchronize my files with all of those providers and on my local drive each of these providers show up as a subfolder.  What's nice about this is that it syncs in the background, automatically uploading and/or downloading based on configuration settings.  It also has a feature where it can put placeholders of the files without downloading the actual content.  And working with a files is made really easy as "opening" the placeholder will trigger odrive to download the file and it will open seamlessly as if the file was always there.

I performed some consolidation and cleanup of files and folders, essentially moving everything to my largest cloud storage account and leaving the rest empty.  This works out okay for me because I store everything locally on a RAID 1 array, and also back up that drive to [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com/).  I configure Backblaze to backup once per night and to run until completed.

I let the applications sync up and went to bed.
